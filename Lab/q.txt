1 i Implement a simple AI-based Sentiment Analyzer in Python using the TextBlob 
library to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.
ii Modify your code to display subjectivity along with the polarity score.
2 i Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse a user-defined graph.
ii Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse a user-defined graph.
3 i Implement the A* algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
ii Modify the same program to compare the total cost of paths obtained from A* and 
Greedy Best-First Search.
4 i Implement an AI Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python where the computer plays 
optimally against the user.
ii Write a Python snippet to display all possible moves with their Minimax scores (short 
version of the game logic).
5 i Build a Propositional Logic Reasoning System that evaluates logical expressions 
using connectives (AND, OR, NOT, →, ↔).
ii Extend the system to accept user input for propositions and evaluate the result 
dynamically.
6 Create a Knowledge Base using First-Order Logic (FOL) for a hospital scenario 
using the kanren library.
ii Write a query to find all doctors who treat a given disease from the knowledge base.
7 i Design a rule-based Expert System for Medical Diagnosis using forward chaining in 
Python.
ii Extend the system to display multiple possible diseases when symptoms overlap 
with more than one rule.
